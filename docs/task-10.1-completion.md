# Task 10.1 Completion: Threshold Edge Cases - Manual QA Scenarios

## Overview
Task 10.1 has been completed with a comprehensive test suite that validates threshold edge cases for DEU (Germany) and ZAF (South Africa), ensuring independent evaluation per side as required by the business logic.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive Test Suite (`src/logic/__tests__/thresholdEdgeCases.test.ts`)
Created a new test file specifically for testing threshold edge cases with 22 test cases covering:

#### DEU (Germany) - Threshold 0 Testing
- **Threshold validation**: Confirms DEU has threshold of 0
- **Zero and positive amounts**: All amounts >= 0 correctly classified as `above_threshold`
- **Negative amounts**: All amounts < 0 correctly classified as `below_threshold` (edge case)
- **Requirement extraction**: Validates correct fields and flags for both threshold buckets
- **Data consistency**: Ensures all threshold functions return consistent results

#### ZAF (South Africa) - Threshold 5000 Boundary Testing
- **Exact boundary testing**: 4999 (below), 5000 (at), 5001 (above)
- **Boundary vicinity testing**: Amounts around the 5000 threshold
- **Requirement extraction**: Validates simple fields below threshold vs. complex groups above threshold
- **Flag validation**: KYC/AML/Wallet attribution flags correctly set per threshold

#### Independent Evaluation Per Side
- **Multi-country scenarios**: Tests DEU + ZAF combinations with various amounts
- **Independent logic**: Confirms each country's threshold evaluation is completely independent
- **Requirement isolation**: Validates that requirements are extracted independently per side
- **Currency handling**: Ensures threshold evaluation uses local currency, not converted amounts

#### Edge Case Coverage
- **Negative amounts**: Proper handling of edge cases
- **Large amounts**: Validation with very large numbers
- **Fractional amounts**: Support for decimal precision (if needed)
- **Business scenarios**: Real-world transaction amount testing

## Key Business Logic Validated

### DEU Threshold 0 Behavior
- **Mathematical correctness**: `amount < 0` → `below_threshold`, `amount >= 0` → `above_threshold`
- **Business reality**: In practice, DEU will almost always be `above_threshold` since negative amounts are rare
- **Requirement consistency**: Above threshold always includes full KYC/AML requirements

### ZAF Threshold 5000 Boundary
- **Precise boundary**: 4999 vs 5000 vs 5001 correctly classified
- **Requirement complexity**: Below threshold uses simple fields, above threshold uses complex groups
- **Flag progression**: KYC/AML/Wallet requirements increase at threshold boundary

### Independent Evaluation
- **Side isolation**: Sumsub and Counterparty requirements evaluated independently
- **No cross-contamination**: One side's threshold doesn't affect the other
- **Currency independence**: Each country's threshold evaluated in local currency

## Test Results
- **Total tests**: 22
- **Status**: All passing ✅
- **Coverage**: Comprehensive edge case validation
- **Integration**: Compatible with existing test suite (173 total tests passing)

## Files Modified
1. **Created**: `src/logic/__tests__/thresholdEdgeCases.test.ts` - New comprehensive test suite
2. **Updated**: `docs/todo.md` - Marked task 10.1 as completed

## Dependencies Satisfied
- ✅ **4.2**: Threshold buckets functionality tested
- ✅ **6.x**: Field normalization and requirement extraction validated
- ✅ **8.2**: Currency conversion independence verified

## Business Value
This test suite ensures that:
- **Regulatory compliance**: Threshold logic works correctly for all amount scenarios
- **Data integrity**: Independent evaluation prevents cross-contamination between sides
- **Edge case handling**: Negative amounts and boundary conditions are properly managed
- **Maintainability**: Comprehensive tests prevent regressions in threshold logic

## Next Steps
Task 10.1 is complete and ready for production use. The test suite provides confidence that threshold edge cases are properly handled and that the independent evaluation per side requirement is fully satisfied.
